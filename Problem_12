Read through the following functions and note how they are similar and how they differ. Then, answer the following questions.

string maisie(string str) {
    Stack<char> storage;
    // Loop A
    for (char ch: str) {
        storage.push(ch);
    }
    // Loop B
    string result;
    while (!storage.isEmpty()) {
        result += storage.pop();
    }
    return result;
}
string saki (string str) {
    Vector<char> storage;
    // Loop C
    for (char ch: str) {
        storage.add(ch);
    }
    // Loop D
    string result;
    while (!storage.isEmpty()) {
        result += storage[0];
        storage.remove(0);
    }
    return result;
}
First, we will examine how each of these functions work.
In one sentence, explain what the loop labeled Loop A accomplishes.
In one sentence, explain what the loop labeled Loop B accomplishes.
In one sentence, explain what the loop labeled Loop C accomplishes.
In one sentence, explain what the loop labeled Loop D accomplishes.
Now, let's put it all together: what is returned as a result of the function call maisie("buster")? What is returned as a result of the function call saki("buster")?
What is the Big O of each function with respect to n where n is the length of the string str?
