Read through the following recursive function. Then, answer the questions that follow. Each question will ask you to trace through the output that is generated by a single recursive function call. Please include some record of the work that you did to generate each answer. This may include notes about the succession of recursive stack frames that you traced through, or other information about you kept track of the information stored at each level of the recursive process. Answers that do not include any record of work will be ineligible for any credit (even if they are correct).

    } else if (x > y) {
        cout << x << " ";
        targaryen(x - y, y);
    } else {
        targaryen(x, y - x);
        cout << y << " ";
